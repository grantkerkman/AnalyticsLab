# Unsupervised Learning and PCA

## Overview

Using Python and unsupervised learning techniques to predict if cryptocurrencies are affected by 24-hour or 7-day price changes. This project demonstrates the use of data analysis and machine learning to gain insights into cryptocurrency price trends.

## Dependencies

This project relies on several Python libraries and dependencies:

- [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/): Used for data manipulation and analysis.
- [hvplot.pandas](https://hvplot.holoviz.org/user_guide/Introduction.html): A library for interactive plotting.
- [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/documentation.html): A machine learning library for clustering and dimensionality reduction.

You can install these dependencies using standard package management tools.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies as mentioned in the "Dependencies" section.
3. Run the project using your preferred Python environment.
4. Follow the Jupyter Notebook or Python script to explore the code and run the cryptocurrency price change prediction.

## Additional Information
