# Pewlett Hackard Employee Database Analysis

Welcome to the Pewlett Hackard Employee Database Analysis project! In this project, you'll embark on a journey to explore and analyze data related to employees who worked at Pewlett Hackard during the 1980s and 1990s. This task involves data modeling, data engineering, and data analysis, enabling you to uncover valuable insights from historical employee data.

## Project Overview

Pewlett Hackard, a fictional company, has tasked you with conducting research on its workforce during the 1980s and 1990s. Your mission includes designing tables to store data from six CSV files, importing the CSV files into a SQL database, and conducting data analysis. Throughout this project, you'll perform the following key steps:

1. **Data Modeling**: You'll begin by inspecting the provided CSV files and creating an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) to represent the relationships between tables. This visual representation will serve as the foundation for your database design.

2. **Data Engineering**: Using the information from the ERD, you'll design a table schema for each of the six CSV files. This step involves defining data types, primary keys, foreign keys, and other constraints. You'll ensure that the tables are created in the correct order to handle foreign keys and import each CSV file into its corresponding SQL table.

3. **Data Analysis**: Once the data is organized in SQL tables, you'll dive into data analysis by answering a series of questions. This analysis includes listing employee details, identifying hiring trends, listing department managers, and more.

## Getting Started

Before diving into the project, here are some initial steps to set up your environment:

1. **Repository Setup**: Create a new repository for this project called `sql-challenge`. Please avoid adding this assignment to an existing repository.

2. **Local Repository**: Clone the newly created repository to your local computer, and create a directory for this challenge, such as `EmployeeSQL`. You will organize your project files within this folder.

## Project Structure

The project's structure is designed to guide you through the three main phases: data modeling, data engineering, and data analysis. Here's how the project is organized:

- **DataModeling**: This section contains the ERD sketch and any related documentation for data modeling.

- **DataEngineering**: Here, you'll find the SQL schema files and instructions for creating tables and importing data.

- **DataAnalysis**: In this section, you'll execute SQL queries to answer specific questions about the employee data.

## Instructions and Tasks

The project is divided into three parts, each with its own set of tasks:

### Data Modeling

- Inspect the CSV files and create an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) to visualize the relationships between tables.

### Data Engineering

- Create a table schema for each of the six CSV files, specifying data types, primary keys, foreign keys, and other constraints.

- Import each CSV file into its corresponding SQL table.

### Data Analysis

- Execute SQL queries to answer a series of questions, including listing employee details, identifying hiring trends, and more.

## Conclusion

The Pewlett Hackard Employee Database Analysis project provides an exciting opportunity to explore and analyze historical employee data. By completing this project, you'll gain valuable experience in data modeling, data engineering, and data analysis, making it a rewarding journey into the world of data.
