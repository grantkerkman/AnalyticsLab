# Pandas Challenge

This project involves the creation and manipulation of Pandas DataFrames to analyze school and standardized test data. The detailed analysis is available in the Jupyter Notebook named `PyCitySchools`. The notebook includes comprehensive analysis and suggestions based on the provided dataset.

**Data Source:** Data for this project was generated by [Mockaroo, LLC](https://www.mockaroo.com/) and [edX Boot Camps LLC](https://bootcamp.cvn.columbia.edu/), intended for educational purposes only, as of 2022.

## Background

As the newly appointed Chief Data Scientist for your city's school district, you play a crucial role in helping the school board and mayor make informed decisions regarding future school budgets and priorities. Your initial task is to analyze district-wide standardized test results, including math and reading scores for every student, along with various school-related data. The goal is to aggregate the data to identify significant trends in school performance.

### District Summary

In the `PyCitySchools` notebook, we perform the necessary calculations to create a high-level snapshot of the district's key metrics in a DataFrame. This summary includes the following information:

- Total number of unique schools
- Total number of students
- Total budget
- Average math score
- Average reading score
- Percentage of students passing math
- Percentage of students passing reading
- Percentage of students passing both math and reading

### School Summary

Additionally, we summarize key metrics for each school in another DataFrame. This summary provides insights into individual schools and includes the following details:

- School name
- School type
- Total number of students
- Total school budget
- Budget per student
- Average math and reading scores
- Percentage of students passing both courses
- List of highest-performing schools (by % overall passing)
- List of lowest-performing schools (by % overall passing)
- Math and reading scores by grade
- Scores categorized by school spending, size, and type

## Usage

To explore the detailed analysis and results, please refer to the Jupyter Notebook named `PyCitySchools`. You can run this notebook in your preferred Python environment.
