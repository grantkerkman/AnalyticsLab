## Background

Welcome to Pymaceuticals, Inc.! We are a pharmaceutical company specializing in anti-cancer medications. In this assignment, we will analyze real-world data related to a recent animal study conducted to screen potential treatments for squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), a common form of skin cancer.

**Study Overview:**
- 249 mice with SCC tumors were treated with various drug regimens.
- The study spanned 45 days, during which tumor development was observed and measured.
- The primary goal was to evaluate the performance of Pymaceuticals' drug of interest, Capomulin, in comparison to other treatment regimens.

As a senior data analyst at Pymaceuticals, your role is to generate the necessary tables and figures for the technical report of the clinical study and provide a top-level summary of the study results.

## Instructions

This assignment is organized into several tasks that will guide you through the analysis process:

1. **Prepare the Data:** Ensure the dataset is properly loaded and cleaned for analysis.

2. **Generate Summary Statistics:** Compute key summary statistics to gain insights into the data.

3. **Create Bar and Pie Charts:** Visualize data using bar charts and pie charts to present key findings.

4. **Calculate Quartiles, Find Outliers, and Create a Box Plot:** Examine data distribution and identify potential outliers.

5. **Create Line and Scatter Plots:** Plot time series data and explore relationships between variables.

6. **Calculate Correlation and Regression:** Perform statistical analysis to understand correlations and regression.

7. **Submit Your Final Analysis:** Summarize your findings and insights from the study.
